PageTitleHelper
===============

PageTitleHelper is a very very simple helper which provides two helper methods for setting page titles. It supports localized titles.

Example
=======

All codes need to be placed in views.

In the view layout (e.g. application.html.erb for instance):
<head>
	...
	<%= site_title "MySite" %>
	...
</head>

In a view:

<div id="content">
	...
	<%= title "Welcome !" %>
	...
</div>
