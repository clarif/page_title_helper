h1. PageTitleHelper

PageTitleHelper is a very very simple helper which provides two helper methods for setting page titles. It supports localized titles.

h2. Example

In the view layout (e.g. @application.html.erb@ for instance):

<pre>
	<head>
		...
		<%= site_title "MySite" %>
		...
	</head>
</pre>


In a view, the title helper takes a parameter which can be either a String or a Symbol. In case of a Symbol, its value is sent first to @I18n.t@ to be translated. In all cases, the page title is added to the @<title/>@ tag after the site name. 


<pre>
	<div id="content">
		...
		<%= title "Welcome !" %>
		...
	</div>
</pre>
